<h3>What is a "Home Inspection"?</h3>
A home inspection is an objective visual analysis of a homes
 structure and systems. An inspection will determine the areas of a
  home that are not performing properly, items that are beyond their
   useful life or are unsafe. Inspections will include areas of the homes
   interior and exterior from the roof to the foundation and the exterior drainage and retaining walls
   . If problems or symptoms are found the inspector may recommend further evaluation. A home inspection is a
   visual inspection to determine problems or conditions that exist at the time of the inspection. A home inspection is not a warranty.
    A warranty can be obtained separately.
<h3>Our standard residential inspection includes:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Roof</li>
    <li>Drainage</li>
    <li>Exterior/Interior</li>
    <li>Foundation</li>
    <li>Basement</li>
    <li>Ventilation</li>
    <li>Insulation</li>
    <li>Plumbing/Pipes</li>
    <li>Electrical</li>
    <li>Cooling/Heating System</li>
    <li>Fireplace and Chimmneys</li>
    <li>Windows</li>
    <li>Doors</li>
    <li>Attic</li>
</ul>
<h3>Top Ten Home Defects</h3>
<ol>
<li class="bold">Roofing Defects</li>
  <div>Problems with roofing material, either due to aging and wear or to improper
    installation are likely to be found in the majority of homes. This does not mean
     that most roofs are in need of replacement, but rather that most are in need of
     some type of maintenance or repair.
</div>
<br />
<li class="bold">Ceiling Stains, Indicating Past or Current Roof Leaks</li>
<div>The problem here is that you often can't tell if the roof still leaks,
  unless it is inspected on a rainy day. Some stains are merely the residual effects
   of leaks that have been repaired. There is also the possibility that ceiling stains
   were caused by a former plumbing leak in the attic.
 </div>
<br />
<li class="bold">Water Intrusion </li>
<div>Water intrusion into basements or crawlspaces due to ground water conditions: Such
  problems can be pervasive, difficult to resolve, and sometimes very damaging to buildings.
   Correction can be as simple as regrading the exterior grounds or adding roof gutters.
    Unfortunately, major drainage improvements are often the only practical solutions, requiring
     costly ground water systems such as French drains designed by experts such as geotechnical engineers.
</div>
<br />
<li class="bold">Electrical Safety Hazards </li>
<div>Electrical safety hazards, especially (but not always) in older homes: Examples are ungrounded outlets,
   lack of ground fault interrupters (shock protection devices), faulty wiring conditions in electrical panels
   or elsewhere in a building, etc. Such problems may be the result of errors at the time of construction, but very
    often they are due to wiring that was added or altered by persons other than qualified electricians.
</div>
<br />
<li class="bold">Rotten Wood</li>
<div>Rotted wood at building exteriors and at various plumbing fixtures: In places where wood stays wet for long periods,
   such as roof eaves, exterior trim, of decks, around tubs and showers, or below loose toilets, fungus infection is very
   likely to attack, resulting in a condition commonly known as dryrot. If left unchecked, damage can become quite extensive.
</div>
<br />
<li class="bold">Building Violations Where Additions and Alterations Were Constructed without Permits</li>
<div>Homeowners will often tell a home inspector, "We added the garage without a permit, but it was all done to code." This statement
   is a red flag to most home inspectors, because no one could possibly know the entire building code, and the average person without
    professional involvement with the code is likely to know very little of it. Whenever an owner offers code assurance, I know that problems
     are likely to be found.
</div>
<br />
<li class="bold">
Unsafe Fireplace and Chimney Conditions</li>
<div>These can range from lack of maintenance, such as neglecting to hire a chimney sweep, to faulty installation of fixtures. Most common among
   these are the lack of spark arrestors and substandard placement of wood-burning stoves. Free-standing fireplaces are typically installed by home
    owners and handymen, people without an adequate knowledge of fire safety requirements. The most common violations in these cases involve insufficient
     clearance between hot metal surfaces and combustible materials within the building. Fire hazards of this kind are often concealed in attics, where
     they remain undiscovered until a roof fire occurs.
</div>
<br />
<li class="bold">Faulty Installation of Water Heaters</li>
<div>In most localities, less than 5% of all water heaters are installed in full compliance with plumbing code requirements. Violations can include inadequate
   strapping, improperly installed overflow piping, unsafe flue conditions, or faulty gas piping. It should also be remembered that today's water heaters are
   designed to have shorter longevity than in times of yore. In fact, leaks can develop in units that are only five years old.
</div>
<br />
<li class="bold">Hazardous Conditions Involving Gas Heaters</li>
<div>Most gas-fueled heaters are in need of some maintenance, if only the changing of an air filter or a long-overdue review by the gas company. In some cases,
  however, gas heaters contain life-threatening defects that can remain undiscovered until too late. These can range from fire safety violations to the venting
  of carbon monoxide into the building. A cracked firebox, for example, can remain undiscovered unless found by an expert or until tragic consequences occur.
</div>
<br />
<li class="bold" style="margin-left:23px">Firewall Violations In Garages</li>
<div>Special fire-resistive construction is required for walls and doors that separate a garage from a dwelling. Violations are common, either due to faulty construction,
   damage or alterations to the garage interior, or changes in code requirements since the home was built. In older homes, where firewalls are not installed, sellers and
   agents will often say that the building predates the code. However, the fire separation requirement for residential garages dates back to 1927..
